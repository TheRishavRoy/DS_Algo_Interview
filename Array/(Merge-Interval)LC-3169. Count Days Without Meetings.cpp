/*
Using Sorting + Merge Intervals

Instead of using an array of size days, store only meeting intervals and merge overlapping ones to count free days.
=============================================================================
Steps
1. Sort the meetings by start time.
2. Merge overlapping intervals to track occupied days.
3. Subtract occupied days from total days.
============================================================================
Sapace:
We only store and process n meetings, not days
Memory usage is O(n) instead of O(days).

Time:
Sorting + Merging is Efficient
Sorting takes O(n log n).
Merging takes O(n).
Overall complexity: O(n log n) (much better than O(n Ã— d)).
